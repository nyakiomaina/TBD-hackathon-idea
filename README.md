# Decentralized Polling System
## Project Description

This project aims to create a decentralized polling system leveraging the power of blockchain technology and Cartesi's layer-2 solutions for off-chain computations. The application allows users to create polls, vote on them, and view the results in a secure, transparent, and efficient manner. This system ensures the integrity and anonymity of votes, providing a new standard for how polls are conducted in the digital age.
Features

- Poll Creation: Users can create polls with multiple choices. Each poll is timestamped and recorded on the Ethereum blockchain to ensure its integrity and immutability.
- Voting: Participants can vote on active polls. Votes are anonymous and securely tallied. The system ensures that each participant can vote only once per poll.
- Off-chain Computation: Utilizes Cartesi's layer-2 solution for off-chain computation. This allows for efficient data processing and result computation without sacrificing security or decentralization.
- Result Computation and Verification: After the polling period ends, results are computed off-chain within a Cartesi Machine and then verified on-chain. This approach reduces gas costs and leverages the computational power of traditional systems while maintaining blockchain's security and integrity.
- Transparency and Security: The smart contract ensures that poll creation, voting, and result computation are transparent and tamper-proof. Users can verify the integrity of polls and results directly on the blockchain.
